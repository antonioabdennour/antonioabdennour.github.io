My experiences as an HSC student have sparked my curiosity in Design Technology, Timber, Multimedia and Food Technology.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I am curious to expand my skillset within the TAS department; for example, becoming familiar and versed on Textiles! Thank you for reading about me.</p>
